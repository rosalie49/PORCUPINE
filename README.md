# PORCUPINE
**P**rincipal Components Analysis to **O**btain **R**egulatory **C**ontributions **U**sing **P**athway-based Interpretation of **N**etwork **E**stimates is an R package to identify biological pathway which drive inter-tumour heterogeneity in a population of gene regulatory networks. It is a Principal Components Analysis (PCA)-based approach that can be used to determine whether a specific set of variables—for example a set of genes in a specific pathway—have coordinated variability in their regulation.

## Method
PORCUPINE uses as input individual patient networks, for example networks modeled using PANDA and LIONESS, as well as a .gmt file that includes biological pathways and the genes belonging to them. For each pathway, it extracts all edges connected to the genes belonging to that pathway and scales each edge across individuals. It then performs a PCA analysis on these edge weights, as well as on a null background that is based on random pathways. To identify significant pathways, PORCUPINE applies a one-tailed t-test and calculates the effect size (ES). 

## Project Status
The project is: _in progress_.
